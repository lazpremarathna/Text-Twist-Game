# Text-Twist-Game
Text Twist is a word game that requires forming minimum of three or more words from six given set of letters. The six letters may include duplicate letters. For example the letters R, E, D, A, W, and R might be given. Possible words to be formed from these letters are for example: rare, ear, dear, ward, and reward. At the end of the game, the possible words that can be formed from the given letters are displayed. 
Design and implement a simplified version of Text Twist. Your game has to accept an input of six letters from the user and there must be at least a minimum of three words that can be formed from the given six letters. The player must be able to enter words that can be formed from the six given letters. The game has to check whether the entered word is a valid and gives the player feedback for each entered word. At the end of the game, all possible words that can be formed from the given letters are displayed. In the simplest version, the player can use, for example, a button to terminate a game. The game should always terminate when the player has found all possible words to be formed.
